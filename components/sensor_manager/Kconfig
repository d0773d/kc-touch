config SENSOR_MANAGER_ENABLE_FAKE_DATA
    bool "Enable simulated sensors when no hardware is detected"
    default y
    help
        Provide a small set of simulated Atlas Scientific EZO sensors when
        the runtime cannot discover any devices on the I2C bus. This keeps
        the YAML-driven UI usable on desktops and during CI without physical
        hardware. Disable this when running exclusively on production rigs.

config SENSOR_MANAGER_FORCE_FAKE_ONLY
    bool "Always use simulated sensors"
    depends on SENSOR_MANAGER_ENABLE_FAKE_DATA
    help
        Force the sensor manager to skip I2C probing entirely and rely solely
        on the built-in simulated dataset. This is useful for unit tests or
        UI development on devices without sensors attached.
